# Flow for Nova

This extension provides [Flow](https://flow.org) typing functionality for Nova.

The extension will automatically start a Flow server using your workspace's `node_modules/.bin/flow`. You can set a custom path in the settings if your Flow executable is located elsewhere.

Please report any issues you encounter!

# Flow for Nova

This extension provides [Flow](https://flow.org) typing functionality for Nova.

The extension will automatically start a Flow server using your workspace's `node_modules/.bin/flow`. You can set a custom path in the settings if your Flow executable is located elsewhere.

Please report any issues you encounter!

> In case you like the theme seen in the screenshots, it's my take on the famous Atom's One Dark theme. You can grab it here: [One Dark Pro](nova://extension/?id=io.becker.OneDarkPro&name=One%20Dark%20Pro) *(Opens the extension directly in Nova.app)*
